# Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ Hi, I'm Tom! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo.

I'm passionate about creating applications that can improve our lives! Right now, I'm learning React to enhance my software development skills!

Favourite Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, yfinance

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing badminton, and hiking! ðŸš¶ðŸš¶
