# Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ Hi, I'm Tom! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo. 

I just finished a project: *LSTM stock predictor*, a regression model that predicts the stock price, go [check it out](https://github.com/TomPn/LSTM_stock_price_predictor)!

I'm passionate about creating applications that can improve our lives! 

Right now, I'm learning deep learning to explore the power of machine learning!

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing badminton, and hiking! ðŸš¶ðŸš¶
