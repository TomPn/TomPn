# Hi There! 👋

🌟 Hi, I'm Tom! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo. 

I just finished a *Online Code Ordering System*, a web application that help a local restaurant manage their customer orders, go [check it out](http://baijialaotang.epizy.com/)!

I'm passionate about creating applications that can improve our lives! Right now, I'm learning React.js to enhance my software development skills!

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing badminton, and hiking! 🚶🚶
