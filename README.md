# Hi There!

ðŸŒŸ Hi, I'm Tom! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo. 

I'm currently working on my startup [Red Robin Financial](https://www.linkedin.com/company/red-robin-financial/about/?viewAsMember=true), a financial services platform that provides investors with financial analytics tools to advise investment decisions.

I am passionate about data science and machine learning, and I hope to use these skills to create applications to make our financial lives easier.

Favourite Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, yfinance

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing badminton, and hiking! ðŸš¶ðŸš¶
