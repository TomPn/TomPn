# Hi There! ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒŸ Hi, I'm Tom! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo. 

I'm currently working on a [Restaurant QR Code Ordering System](http://baijialaotang.epizy.com/), a web application that help a local restaurant manage their customer orders.

I'm passionate about using data science and machine learning to create applications to improve our financial lives.

Favourite Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, yfinance

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing badminton, and hiking! ğŸš¶ğŸš¶
