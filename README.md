# Hi There!

ðŸŒŸ Hi, I'm Tom! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo. 

I'm currently working on my startup [Red Robin Financial](https://www.linkedin.com/company/red-robin-financial/about/?viewAsMember=true) 

I'm passionate about data science and love innovating ideas that can be implemented using **Python**! I am well-acquainted with libraries such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Yahoo Finance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

I'm currently learning **machine learning** (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow) and **web development** (HTML, CSS, Javascript) to create applications that can be beneficial to the society! (^o^)

When I'm free, I like listening to music, playing badminton, and hiking! ðŸš¶ðŸš¶
