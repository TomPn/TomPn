# Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ Hi, I'm Tom! I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Finance at the University of Waterloo. 

I'm currently working on my startup [Red Robin Financial](https://www.linkedin.com/company/red-robin-financial/about/?viewAsMember=true), a financial services platform that provides investors with financial analytics tools to advise investment decisions.

I'm passionate about using data science and machine learning to create applications to improve our financial lives.

Favourite Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, yfinance

In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing badminton, and hiking! ðŸš¶ðŸš¶
